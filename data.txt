Billingham is a town and civil parish in the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, England. 
The town is on the north side of the River Tees and is governed by Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council. 
The settlement had previously formed its own borough but was overshadowed by its neighbour. 
The town had a population of 1 at the 2011 Census.[3]
The town was founded circa. 650 by a group of Angles known as Billa's people[4] which is where the name Billingham is thought to have originated. 
In modern history, the chemical industry, and in particular the company ICI, has played an important role in the growth of Billingham. 
Today ICI no longer operates in Billingham, having been replaced by other companies.
